<h3>About</h3>
<p> I am a bachelor year student pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) in Computer Engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University.

I consider myself to be hard-working and determined when it comes to responsibilities. I am passionate about new technologies and always intrigued by the advancements in them. My fascination with computers and related technologies has helped me become a skillful and competent individual. I am always eager to learn and understand new technologies and never give up on something until I get it done right or excel at it. I accept new challenges that come my way and try to face them with a positive attitude. </p>

*Abstract*: This Research establishes a safety system for mask detection during this COVID-19 pandemic. Face mask detection has seen an overwhelming growth in the realm of Computer vision and deep learning, since the unprecedented COVID-19 global pandemic that has mandated wearing masks in public places. To tackle the situation, we have come up with a system which uses several algorithms and techniques to identify unmasked individuals using various mask detection models and such people will be charged fines for violating rules. The proposed approach in this project adopts frameworks of deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV libraries to detect face masks in real-time. To detect masks, initially, the model is trained using the multi-Task Cascade Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN) algorithm with the database of faces provided. The face is first detected using OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision) and those image frames are stored and passed to the mask detection classifier for classification. For facial detection, the Viola Jones algorithm is used, which is also known as the Haar Cascade algorithm.

<h3>Projects</h3>

 - **JabAlert**
*May 2021 - Aug 2021*
[Visit Project Repository](https://github.com/tabrezshaikh13/jabalert)
Designed, developed and built a web portal that automates the process of checking vaccination slots on CoWIN and alerts the registered user through email whenever there is a slot available at their vaccination center. The portal was hosted for almost 4 months on Amazon Web Services (AWS) completely and gained around 130 users all over India. This automation was done using technologies like Java and Spring Boot at the backend, MySQL for storing user's data and Thymeleaf to render the frontend and using publicly avaible CoWIN API to search for available vaccination slots at a particular pincode.

- **Covitrack**
*Jan 2021 - Feb 2021*
[Visit Project Respository](https://github.com/tabrezshaikh13/covitrack)
Built a production-ready Web Application that tracks real-time Covid-19 statistics (total cases, deaths, recoveries and active cases worldwide) using Java, Spring-Boot framework and Apache Maven build tool. Used publicly available REST APIs as data set and extracted the data to make it presentable where data can be visualized at a global or country level.

- **Java Calculator with GUI**
*Dec 2020 - Dec 2020*
[Visit Project Respository](https://github.com/tabrezshaikh13/java-swing-calculator)
Built a calculator application for Windows/Mac/Linux using Java and Java Swing framework that can be interacted with using Graphical User Interface.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**
*Apr 2020 - Apr 2020*
[Visit Project Respository](https://github.com/tabrezshaikh13/tictactoe)
Built a basic console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java.
